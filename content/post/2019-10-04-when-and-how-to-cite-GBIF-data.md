## Finding and accessing data

There is a lot of GBIF-mediated data available. More than [1.3 B occurrence records](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search) covering hundreds of thousands of species in all part of the worlds. All free, open and available at the touch of a button. Users can download data through the GBIF.org portal, via the [GBIF API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary), or one of the third-party tools available for programmatic access, e.g. rgbif. 

If there one area in which GBIF has been immensely successful, it's making the data available to users. 

## Using data

Data is used a lot, too. One of my responsibilities is to track uses of GBIF-mediated data, especially in scientific literature. This is a somehwat complicated business, explained [elsewhere](https://www.gbif.org/literature-tracking), but as of today (4 October 2019) we've logged [3941](https://www.gbif.org/resource/search?contentType=literature&literatureType=journal&relevance=GBIF_USED&peerReview=true) peer-reviewed journal articles that to some extent relied of GBIF-mediated data to reach their conclusions.

In other words, users are getting the data ...

## Citing data

As is good scientific practice, authors include bibliographic references to other people's work when citing them in a paper. When you use other people's data—for instance, obtained through GBIF—the same principle applies. In fact, the [Data user agreement](https://www.gbif.org/terms/data-user) that governs use of data from GBIF _specifically_ requires all users to 

> publicly acknowledge, following the scientific convention of citing sources in conjunction with the use of the data, the Data Publishers whose biodiversity data they have used

and also

> comply with the terms and conditions included in the licence selected by each Data Publisher, and the licensing information included with each data download
