# Gridded datasets are now flagged on the GBIF registry

This update builds on work from a [previous blog post](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/finding-gridded-datasets/). 

> Gridded datasets are broadly **datasets that have low coordinate precision** due to rasterized sampling or rounding. This can be a data quality issue because a user might assume an occurrence record has more precision than it actually does. 

# Current statistics

* **572** datasets are currently flagged as gridded or rasterized on the registry.
* **488** of these are regularly spaced at 0.1 decimal degrees (around 10 km)
* **40** datasets  are regularly spaced at >0.1 decimal degrees [example](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/81c2b870-f762-11e1-a439-00145eb45e9a)

These **final 40 datasets** with very large spacing are probably of most concern to those needing precise location information. 

# What datasets were flagged? 

* Datasets with **>20 unique lat-lon points**.
* Datasets that have **>30% of their unique lat-lon points with the same nearest neighbor distance**
* Only datasets with a nearest neighbor distances **>0.02 decimal degrees were flagged**.
* WGS84 is assumed to calculate distances in decimal degrees. 
* **All unique occurrence points** from each GBIF dataset have been used this time. This means I was able to flag more datasets.  


# How can this information be used? 

The current algorithm for detecting gridded datasets relies on nearest neighbor distances between unique occurrence points. This is described in more detail in a [previous post](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/finding-gridded-datasets/).

This produces a simple measure of distance in decimal degrees that can be used for filtering out  datasets that might have a coordinate precision above what is expected from the study. The following api call will get all of the datasets flagged as "gridded" in the GBIF registry. 

```
http://api.gbif.org/v1/dataset?machineTagNamespace=griddedDataSet.jwaller.gbif.org&limit=1000

```

Such an api call could be easily incorporated into R packages for data cleaning, such as [CoordinateCleaner](https://github.com/ropensci/CoordinateCleaner). In the meantime, I have created a simple function to extract gridded dataset keys from the registry. The following will install a package that can be used for extracting flagged datasets from the registry. 


```R
# Installation
devtools::install_github("jhnwllr/griddedDatasets", subdir="gbifgridded")

```

You can now use the `gbifgridded::getGriddedKeys` function to filter out low resolution datasets. 


```R 
library(rgbif)
library(dplyr) 

# taxon key for Syntrichia norvegica Weber, 1804 (a moss)
taxonKey=2671266

# Get occurrence data for a moss occurring in SWEDEN
occData <- occ_data(taxonKey=taxonKey,
country="SE", # get only from SWEDEN to limit results
hasGeospatialIssue=FALSE, # remove those with other geospatial issues 
hasCoordinate=TRUE, # get only with coordinates
limit=1000)$data # get first 1000 records

# only get dataset keys with spacing greater than around 10 km
keysToFilter <- gbifgridded::getGriddedKeys(minDistance = 0.1) 

nrow(occData)

cleanData <- occData %>% # should be around 140 occurrence records
filter(!datasetKey %in% keysToFilter) 

nrow(cleanData) # should remove around 50 low resolution occurrences 

```

You can also run the function with no arguments to get a list of all the datasetkeys that are gridded. 

```R 
gbifgridded::getGriddedKeys()
```
