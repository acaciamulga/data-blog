<p>Geographic outliers at <strong>GBIF</strong> are a known problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Outliers</strong> can be errors, coordinates with high uncertainty, or simply occurrences from an under-sampled region.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In data cleaning pipelines outliers are often removed (even if they are legitimate points) because the researcher does not have time to verify each record one-by-one. In almost all cases, outlier points are occurrences that <strong>need attention</strong>. Currently, there is no outlier detection implemented at <strong>GBIF</strong> and it is up to the user to remove outliers themselves (e.g. using CoordinateCleaner, DIVA-GIS)</p>

<p><strong>DBSCAN</strong> is a simple and popular clustering algorithm. Here is a nice <a href="https://ltjds.github.io/post/20200611/">introduction</a>. It uses distance and a minimum number of points per cluster to classify a point as an outlier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise” - DBSCAN</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since <strong>GBIF</strong> mediated occurrence data can be very patchy, clustering is important. One advantage of <strong>DBSCAN</strong> is that it does not need to know the expected number of clusters in advance. Also <strong>DBSCAN</strong> uses only distance and <strong>not</strong> some additional environmental variables like <a href="https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html">Bioclim</a>. This makes it simple, but also vulnerable to certain types of false positives.</p>

<h2>Plotted Examples</h2>
<p>Here I plot some examples of <strong>DBSCAN</strong> outlier flagging.</p>
<p>Details :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DBSCAN</strong> was run with haversine distance.</li>
<li>Maximum distance was set to <strong>&lt;1500km</strong>.</li>
<li>Minimum points was set to <strong>3</strong>.</li>
<li>Points here are unique points by (specieskey, lat-lon).</li>
<li>Only run with species having <strong>&gt;30</strong> and <strong>&lt;30,000</strong> unique points.</li>
<li>The gray gray circle around each point has a radius=~1500km.</li>
<li>I was able to run this on <strong>all Plants</strong>, <strong>Animals</strong> and <strong>Fungi</strong> in under an hour with GBIF’s current cluster setup.</li>
<li>No point was classified as an outlier if the publisher filled in the <strong>establishment means</strong> (where a publisher can put in that the occurrence is managed, in a zoo, garden ect.) or <strong>basis of record</strong> = <strong>Living Specimen</strong> or <strong>Fossil</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Example 1</b></p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-07-06-outlier-detection-using-dbscan_files//Thermopsis%20lupinoides.svg" /></p>
<p>The two <span style="color:#FCB008"><b>outlier points</b></span> ( <a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2273331417">1</a>, <a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1702253738">2</a> ) in this example: 1. <strong>Botanical Garden in Denver</strong> 2. <strong>Herbarium in Norway</strong>. These are two points that most users would probably want to exclude. If you had 1000s of species, you would not want to do this manually.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color: #F9F9F9">
<p><b>Example 2</b></p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-07-06-outlier-detection-using-dbscan_files//Lycoris%20aurea.svg" /></p>
<p>I think most agree that these <span style="color:#FCB008"><b>two points</b></span> ( <a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2423015120">1</a>, <a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2429371864">2</a> ) in North America are the most <strong>needing of attention/verification</strong>. These points are probably within private gardens.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color: #F9F9F9">
<p><b>Example 3</b></p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-07-06-outlier-detection-using-dbscan_files//Cricotopus%20festivellus.svg" /></p>
<p>Sometimes lacking <strong>environmental information</strong> produces results ( <a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2565934285">1</a> ) that a human being might think is probably not an outlier. In any case the result is reasonable, and out of all the points, the <span style="color:#FCB008"><b>outlier point</b></span> is probably the one that <strong>needs the most attention</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color: #F9F9F9">
<p><b>Example 4</b></p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-07-06-outlier-detection-using-dbscan_files//Tradescantia%20occidentalis.svg" /></p>
<p>This <span style="color:#FCB008"><b>outlier</b></span> ( <a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1928465280">1</a> ) is near a <strong>botanical garden</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color: #F9F9F9">
<p><b>Example 5</b></p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-07-06-outlier-detection-using-dbscan_files//Taphrina%20farlowii.svg" /></p>
<p>This ( <a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1829967830">1</a> ) example shows that <strong>DBSCAN</strong> is able to <strong>cluster effectively</strong> while flagging an <span style="color:#FCB008"><b>outlier point</b></span> with low additional support in Japan.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color: #F9F9F9">
<p><b>Example 6</b></p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-07-06-outlier-detection-using-dbscan_files//Manducus%20maderensis.svg" /></p>
<p>This example shows that <strong>DBSCAN</strong> does not do well when the species is poorly sampled in some regions, like the ocean. Also <strong>DBSCAN</strong> tends to flag occurrences on <strong>islands</strong> and <strong>other remote places</strong>.</p>

<div id="outlier-detection-vs-error-detection" class="section level2">
<h2>Outlier detection vs error detection</h2>
<p><strong>Outlier</strong> detection and <strong>error</strong> detection are different. If your goal is to produce a system with no false positives, <strong>it will fail</strong>. Probably combining this distance method with other environmentally informed methods would be very powerful way to flag outliers.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong> of DBSCAN :</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Easy to Understand</li>
<li>Only two parameters to set</li>
<li>Scales well</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Only uses distance</li>
<li>Must choose parameter settings</li>
<li>Sensitive to sparse global sampling<br />
</li>
<li>Does not include any other relevant information</li>
</ul>

If you are interested in using biodiversity data you need to understand what it means. An example using <a href="https://twitter.com/atlaslivingaust?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><span class="citation">@atlaslivingaust</span></a> data for Onychophora: the records far from the wetter margins of the continent are all either geocodes for states (WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THIS?) or bad geocodes. <a href="https://t.co/IZgZ9PgSIx">pic.twitter.com/IZgZ9PgSIx</a>

<p>DBSCAN <strong>would not</strong> do well at flagging any of the outlier’s in this example from twitter. Environmentally-informed <a href="https://www.gbif.org/document/80528/principles-and-methods-of-data-cleaning-primary-species-and-species-occurrence-data">reverse jackknifing</a> would probably do better in these cases.</p>

<h2>Percentage of taxa-group outliers</h2>
<p><img src="/post/2020-07-06-outlier-detection-using-dbscan_files//percent_class_outliers.svg" /></p>
<p>Well sampled groups like Birds, Mammals, and flowering plants do not have many outliers. Less well-sampled groups, will have more outliers, which might not be “errors” but false positives caused by sparse sampling. Fortunately, if the class is somewhat well sampled &gt;50K records, the outlier flagging rate is less than 1% points.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-07-06-outlier-detection-using-dbscan_files//percent_dataset_outliers.svg" /></p>
<p>It is difficult to judge whether a dataset with a high percentage of outliers contains more “errors” or whether it has occurrences from under sampled regions (like the ocean or Siberia).</p>

<div id="current-implementation-details" class="section level2">
<h2>Current implementation details</h2>
<p>Currently this DBSCAN-outlier detection is an <strong>internal tool</strong>. I am using it to find errors and assess dataset quality. It is a Spark job written in Scala ( <a href="https://github.com/jhnwllr/gbif-dbscan-outliers">github</a> ).</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments if <strong>DBSCAN-based-outlier flagging</strong> is something <strong>GBIF</strong> should do?</p>
