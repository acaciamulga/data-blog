<p><span style="color:#509E2F"><b>Citizen Science</b></span> datasets on GBIF plotted with all other (<span style="color:#E8E8E8"><b>gray</b></span>) GBIF datasets (&gt;100K occurrences). There are many citizen science datasets with millions of occurrences (<strong>eBird</strong>, (Swedish) <strong>Artportalen</strong>), and the top 3 datasets on GBIF are all citizen science datasets. But in terms of number of unique species, only <strong>iNaturalist</strong> competes with large museum datasets like <strong>Smithsonian NMNH</strong>.</p>

<p>Because of very large datasets like <strong>eBird</strong> and <strong>Artportalen</strong>, <span style="color:#509E2F"><b>Citizen Science</b></span> makes up a large percentage of the <span style="color:#231F20"><b>total occurrence records</b></span> on <strong>GBIF</strong>.</p>

<p>Also mostly because of <strong>eBird</strong>, <strong>96%</strong> of bird-records (<strong>Aves</strong>) come from <span style="color:#509E2F"><b>Citizen Science</b></span> datasets. Similarly <strong>eBird</strong> (with &gt;500M records) also makes up most of the Kingdom <strong>Animalia</strong> occurrence records. Less than 500 citizen science datasets make up <strong>36%</strong> of insect (<strong>Insecta</strong>) occurrence records on GBIF.</p>

<h1>What percentage of GBIF-species have <span style="color:#509E2F"><b>citizen scientists</b></span> re-discovered?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This does not mean the <strong>re-discovery</strong> was unique to citizen science datasets.</p>

<p>I chose to use only species on GBIF <strong>with at least 1 occurrence record</strong> instead of the GBIF backbone taxonomy, as many named species do not have any occurrences on GBIF see <a href="https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-checklist-datasets-and-data-gaps/">previous blog post</a> and <a href="https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/2019-04-23-gbif-checklist-datasets-and-data-gaps_files/popularGroupsCoverageBackbone.svg">here</a>. It must also be due to some differences in naming conventions between eBird and some other GBIF datasets, that results in only 70% <strong>Aves</strong> coverage. I have also excluded fossils from this graph.</p>
