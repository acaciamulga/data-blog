<p>Recently a user noticed that there were Asian Red Pandas (Ailuridae) occurring in North America.</p>
<p>The vocabulary used by GBIF comes from TDWG. <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#livingspecimen" class="uri">https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#livingspecimen</a></p>

<p>This user correctly looked to <strong>basis of record</strong> to diagnose the problem.</p>
<p>But all of the records were “Preserved Specimen”.</p>
<p>Did a musuem staff member make a mistake?</p>
<p>Sometimes a preserved specimen will be harvested for a museum from a zoo. In such cases, the animal never occurred naturally. It went from “living specimen - &gt; preserved specimen” so to speak, so the musuem staff correctly labeled the specimen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no easy way to filter such cases. In the future it might be possible to construct niche models or identify</p>

<p>“Preserved specimen” usually means the record comes from a museum like this one:

<p>Sometimes a preserved specimen will be harvested for a museum from a zoo. In such cases, the animal never occurred naturally. It went from “living specimen - &gt; preserved specimen” so to speak.</p>
<p>This occurrence went from a zoo (Seattle; Woodland Park Zoo) to a museum, and presumably never occurred in its natural habitat.

<p>Unfortunately, there is no easy way to filter such cases. Perhaps cross checking with a checklist of North American mammals might help.</p>
