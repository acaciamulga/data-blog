<p>Recently a user noticed that there were <strong>Asian Red Pandas</strong> (Ailuridae) occurring in <a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?basis_of_record=PRESERVED_SPECIMEN&amp;country=US&amp;taxon_key=9673">North America</a>, and wondered if someone had made a mistake. When an occurrence observation comes from a <strong>zoo</strong> or <strong>botanical garden</strong>, it is usually considered a <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#livingspecimen">living specimen</a>, but when it comes from a museum it is usually called a <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#preservedspecimen">preserved specimen</a>. This label helps users remove records that they might not want, which come from zoos.</p>

<p>The Asian Red Panda the user <a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1702720584">found</a> in the United States was labeled as a <strong>preserved specimen</strong> because it had been collected in the United States from a zoo. So the red panda really was from the <strong>United States</strong>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>occurrence record ID</strong>: <a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1702720584">1702720584</a> <br>
<strong>Locality</strong>: Seattle; Woodland Park <strong>Zoo</strong><br>
<strong>Event remarks</strong>: euthanized due to heart failure</p>

<p>Such edged cases are difficult to filter using <strong>basis of record</strong> only. Probably the best way to filter these cases would be to filter any record that has “Zoo” or “Botanical Garden” in the <strong>verbatim locality</strong> column, although this would require downloading the larger <strong>Darwin Core Files</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps in the future GBIF should consider flagging records that occur near zoos or botanical gardens.</p>
