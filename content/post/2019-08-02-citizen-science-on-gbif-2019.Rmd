<span style="color:#509E2F"><b>Citizen Science</b></span> datasets on GBIF plotted with all other (<span style="color:#E8E8E8"><b>gray</b></span>) GBIF datasets (>100K occurrences). There are many citizen science datasets with millions of occurrences (**eBird**, (Swedish) **Artportalen**), and the top 3 datasets on GBIF are all citizen science datasets. But in terms of number of unique species, only **iNaturalist** competes with large museum datasets like **Smithsonian NMNH**.

Because of very large datasets like **eBird** and **Artportalen**, <span style="color:#509E2F"><b>Citizen Science</b></span> makes up a large percentage of the <span style="color:#231F20"><b>total occurrence records</b></span> on **GBIF**.

Also mostly because of **eBird**, **96%** of bird-records (**Aves**) come from <span style="color:#509E2F"><b>Citizen Science</b></span> datasets. Similarly **eBird** (with >500M records) also makes up most of the Kingdom **Animalia** occurrence records. Less than 500 citizen science datasets make up **36%** of insect (**Insecta**) occurrence records on GBIF.

# What percentage of GBIF-species have <span style="color:#509E2F"><b>citizen scientists</b></span> re-discovered? 

> Note: This does not mean the **re-discovery** was unique to citizen science datasets.

I chose to use only species on GBIF **with at least 1 occurrence record** instead of the GBIF backbone taxonomy, as many named species do not have any occurrences on GBIF see [previous blog post](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-checklist-datasets-and-data-gaps/) and [here](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/2019-04-23-gbif-checklist-datasets-and-data-gaps_files/popularGroupsCoverageBackbone.svg). It must also be due to some differences in naming conventions between eBird and some other GBIF datasets, that results in only 70% **Aves** coverage. I have also excluded fossils from this graph.
