Recently a user noticed that there were Asian Red Pandas (Ailuridae) occurring in North America. 

The vocabulary used by GBIF comes from TDWG. https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#livingspecimen

This user correctly looked to **basis of record** to diagnose the problem. 

But all of the records were "Preserved Specimen". 

Did a musuem staff member make a mistake? 


Sometimes a preserved specimen will be harvested for a museum from a zoo. In such cases, the animal never occurred naturally. It went from "living specimen - > preserved specimen" so to speak, so the musuem staff correctly labeled the specimen.

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to filter such cases. In the future it might be possible to construct niche models or identify

"Preserved specimen" usually means the record comes from a museum like this one:

This occurrence went from a zoo (Seattle; Woodland Park Zoo) to a museum, and presumably never occurred in its natural habitat.

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to filter such cases. Perhaps cross checking with a checklist of North American mammals might help.
