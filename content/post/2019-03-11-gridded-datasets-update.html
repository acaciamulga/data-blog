<h1>Gridded datasets are now flagged on the GBIF registry</h1>
<p>This update builds on work from a <a href="https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/finding-gridded-datasets/">previous blog post</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gridded datasets are broadly <strong>datasets that have low coordinate precision</strong> due to rasterized sampling or rounding. This can be a data quality issue because a user might assume an occurrence record has more precision than it actually does.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="current-statistics" class="section level1">
<h1>Current statistics</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>572</strong> datasets are currently flagged as gridded or rasterized on the registry.</li>
<li><strong>488</strong> of these are rasterized at around 0.1 decimal degrees (around 10 km)</li>
<li><strong>40</strong> datasets are rasterized at &gt;0.1 decimal degrees <a href="https://www.gbif.org/dataset/81c2b870-f762-11e1-a439-00145eb45e9a">example</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These <strong>final 40 datasets</strong> with very large spacing are probably of most concern to those doing research projects with GBIF data.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-datasets-were-flagged" class="section level1">
<h1>What datasets were flagged?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Datasets with <strong>&gt;20 unique lat-lon points</strong>.</li>
<li>Datasets that have <strong>&gt;30% of their unique lat-lon points with the same nearest neighbor distance</strong></li>
<li>Only datasets with a nearest neighbor distances &gt;0.02 decimal degrees were flagged.</li>
<li>WGS84 is assumed to calcuate distances.</li>
<li><strong>All uniuqe occurrence points</strong> from each GBIF dataset have been used this time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="how-can-this-information-be-used" class="section level1">
<h1>How can this information be used?</h1>
<p>The current algorithm for detecting gridded datasets relies on nearest neighbor distances between unique occurrence points. This is described in more detail in a <a href="https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/finding-gridded-datasets/">previous post</a>.</p>
<p>This produces a simple measure of distance in decimal degrees that can be used for filtering out datasets that might have a coordinate precision above what is expected from the study. The following api call will get all of the datasets flagged as “gridded” on the GBIF registry.</p>
<pre><code>http://api.gbif.org/v1/dataset?machineTagNamespace=griddedDataSet.jwaller.gbif.org&amp;limit=1000
</code></pre>
<p>This information can be incorporated easily into popular R packages for data cleaning, such as <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/CoordinateCleaner">CoordinateCleaner</a>. While this happens, I have created a simple function to extract rasterized keys from the registry. The following will install a package that can be used for extracting flagged datasets from the registry.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Installation
devtools::install_github(&quot;jhnwllr/griddedDatasets&quot;, subdir=&quot;gbifgridded&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>You can now use the <code>gbifgridded::getGriddedKeys</code> function to filter out low resolution datasets.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rgbif)
library(dplyr) 

# taxon key for Syntrichia norvegica Weber, 1804 (a moss)
taxonKey=2671266

# Get occurrence data for a moss occurring in SWEDEN
occData &lt;- occ_data(taxonKey=taxonKey,
country=&quot;SE&quot;, # get only from SWEDEN to limit results
hasGeospatialIssue=FALSE, # remove those with other geospatial issues 
hasCoordinate=TRUE, # get only with coordinates
limit=1000)$data # get first 1000 records

# only get dataset keys with spacing greater than around 10 km
keysToFilter &lt;- gbifgridded::getGriddedKeys(minDistance = 0.1) 

nrow(occData)

cleanData &lt;- occData %&gt;% # should be around 140 occurrence records
filter(!datasetKey %in% keysToFilter) 

nrow(cleanData) # should remove around 50 low resolution occurrences 
</code></pre>
<p>You can also run the function with no arguments to get a list of all the datasetkeys that are gridded.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gbifgridded::getGriddedKeys()</code></pre>
