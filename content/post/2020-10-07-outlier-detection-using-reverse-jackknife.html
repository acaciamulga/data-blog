<p><strong>Environmental outliers</strong> are a common problem for ecological modelers using <strong>GBIF</strong> occurrence data. Currently, however, there is no outlier detection implemented at GBIF.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-07-10-outlier-detection-using-reverse-jackknife_files//surface_plot.jpg" /></p>
<p>One common way to remove these outliers is by using <strong>reverse jackknifing</strong> on <a href="https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html">environmental surfaces</a>. This type of outlier detection takes the environmental values from point occurrences and sees whether the occurrence is an uncommon value in climate space ( <a href="https://www.gbif.org/document/80528/principles-and-methods-of-data-cleaning-primary-species-and-species-occurrence-data">reference pg 51</a> ).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The jackknife method works by first calculating the sample mean, standard deviation and range; and then steps through the sorted values comparing the distance to the mean of it and the next value. Where the distance to mean between values is above a threshold level then that sample value and those further away from the mean are flagged as outliers. An outlierness metric is also calculated for the sample value. - <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/ala-dataquality/wikis/DETECTED_OUTLIER_JACKKNIFE.wiki">source link</a></p>

<p><strong>Environmental outliers</strong> can arise for a few reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A point that is a mistake (mirrored lat-lon, some other mistake)</li>
<li>A point that is a centroid (of a cournty or region) <a href="https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/country-centroids/">previous blog post</a></li>
<li>A point located at a zoo, herbarium, or other institution</li>
<li>A point sampled from a gridded dataset</li>
<li>A point occurs in a micro-climate that is below the resolution of the climate surface</li>
<li>Or naturally because of chance</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1-4</strong> are usually seen as undesirable for most modelers.</p>
<p>Here is a typical result from a reverse-jackknifing run. The <strong>outlier</strong> occurs at the <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/onprc">Oregon Regional Primate Research Center</a>.</p>

<p>Cumulative frequency plots are to the right. Bioclimatic surface values are on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis. <strong>Black-colored points</strong> very much to the right or left or right are outliers. I also write the number (7) of other surfaces that flagged this point as an outlier as a little number next to the point. Because of multiple-comparisons, a point should probably not be considered a “true outlier” unless it an outlier in &gt; 5 surfaces.</p>
<p><a href="https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/outlier-detection-using-dbscan/">Previously</a>, I discussed a techinque for discovering outliers that uses <strong>distance</strong> from other points. In this example, a distance based-method would also spot this outlier. <strong>Environmental surfaces</strong>, however, give us the power to spot outliers that occur within the main-blob of other occurrence points.</p>

<p>Currently it uses bioclim data from 19 bioclimatic surfaces at a 0.1 degree resolution. Bioclim is only available for land, so no aquatic species could be run.</p>
