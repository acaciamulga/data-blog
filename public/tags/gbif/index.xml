      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post, a lot more sequence-based data has been made available on GBIF this past year. MGnify alone, published 295 datasets for a total of 13,285,109 occurrences. Even though most of these occurrences are Bacteria or Chromista, more than a million of them are animals and more than 300,000 are plants. So chances are, that even if you are not interested in bacteria, you might encounter sequence-based data on GBIF.</description>

      <title>Sequence-based data on GBIF - Sharing your data</title>

      <description>GBIF is trying to make it easier to share sequence-based data. In fact, this past year alone, we worked with UNITE to integrate species hypothesis for fungi and with EMBL-EBI to publish 295 metagenomics datasets.
Unfortunately, documentation is not as quick to follow. Although we have now an FAQ on the topic, I thought that anyone could use a blog post with some advice and examples.
Note that this blog post is not intended to be documentation.</description>

      <description>Link To App
Explanation of toolThis tool plots the downloads through time for species or other taxonomic groups with more than 25 downloads at GBIF. Downloads at GBIF most often occur through the web interface. In a previous post, we saw that most users are downloading data from GBIF via filtering by scientific name (aka Taxon Key). Since the GBIF index currently sits at over 1 billion records (a 400+GB csv), most users will simplying filter by their taxonomic group of interest and then generate a download.</description>

      <title>GBIF data quality issues and flags what do they mean?</title>

      <description>GBIF gets records from around 1600 (and counting) occurrence datasets.Not all of the data-providers have the time or resources to make sure their datasets are free from errors.
As a service to the biodiversity user community, GBIF flags records that might contain an obvious issue. Some flags are not easy to understand, and most users are probably not aware that they exist or filter them all out by default by leaving the “include records where coordinates are flagged as suspcious” unchecked.</description>
