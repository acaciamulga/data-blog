      <description>Can we automatically label citizen science datasets? The short answer is yes, partially.
Why label GBIF datasets as &amp;ldquo;citizen science&amp;rdquo;? What is citizen science? Citizen science is scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur (or non-professional) scientists. Citizen science is sometimes described as &amp;ldquo;public participation in scientific research,&amp;rdquo; participatory monitoring, and participatory action research (wikipedia definition).
Citizen science on GBIF A 2016 study showed that nearly half of all occurrence records shared through the GBIF network come from datasets with significant volunteer contributions (for more information, see our &amp;ldquo;citizen science&amp;rdquo; page on gbif.</description>

      <description>The GBIF maps API is an under-used but powerful web service provided by GBIF. The maps API is used by the main GBIF portal to create the maps including the big map used on gbif.org. We can make a simple call to the API by pasting the link below into a web browser.

      <description>Link To App
Explanation of toolThis tool plots the downloads through time for species or other taxonomic groups with more than 25 downloads at GBIF. Downloads at GBIF most often occur through the web interface. In a previous post, we saw that most users are downloading data from GBIF via filtering by scientific name (aka Taxon Key). Since the GBIF index currently sits at over 1 billion records (a 400+GB CSV), most users will simplying filter by their taxonomic group of interest and then generate a download.</description>

      <title>GBIF data quality issues and flags what do they mean?</title>

      <description>FlagsNot all data that GBIF recieves is perfect or “fit-for-use” if you want to be politically correct.
Data Quality flags are probably an under-used GBIF feature as some flags are not easy to understand.
In this post I will demystify some of the data quality flags at GBIF.
Coordinates RoundedThis flag gets the top spot because the names has two reasonable interpretations.</description>
