      <description>Citizen Science datasets on GBIF plotted with all other (gray) GBIF datasets (&amp;gt;100K occurrences).

But in terms of number of unique species, only iNaturalist competes with large museum datasets like Smithsonian NMNH.
Because of very large datasets like eBird and Artportalen, Citizen Science makes up a large percentage of the total occurrence records on GBIF.</description>
