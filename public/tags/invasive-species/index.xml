      <description>Until recently it was not possible to download more than a few hundred species at the same time. This is unfortunately is still true for downloads through the portal, which are limited to around 200 taxon keys (species, genus, family, kingdom â€¦). This is due to limitations in browser and the http GET limit. A recent change, has now made it possible to request more species names (up to 9000) in some cases through an http request.</description>
