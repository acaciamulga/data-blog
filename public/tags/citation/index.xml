      <description>During the first-ever virtual GBIF 2021 Global Nodes Meeting, GBIFS hosted a &amp;ldquo;game show&amp;rdquo;: a one-hour &amp;ldquo;battle of Nodes vs. helpdesk&amp;rdquo;. The not-so-hidden goal was to demonstrate some of the lesser known functionalities of GBIF.org through a fun, interactive session.
 The following is a summary of the questions and answers from this session, plus some extras that did not manage to make it into the time frame of the event.</description>

      <description>Finding and accessing data There is a lot of GBIF-mediated data available. More than 1.3 B occurrence records covering hundreds of thousands of species in all part of the worlds. All free, open and available at the touch of a button. Users can download data through the GBIF.org portal, via the GBIF API, or one of the third-party tools available for programmatic access, e.g. rgbif.
If there is one area in which GBIF has been immensely successful, it&amp;rsquo;s making the data available to users.</description>
