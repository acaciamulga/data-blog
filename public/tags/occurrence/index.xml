      <description>You are a data publisher of occurrence data through GBIF.org, care about your data quality, and wonder what to do about the issue flags that show up on your occurrences. You might have noticed a new type flag this year relating to collection and institution codes and identifiers. They are the result of our attempt at linking specimens records to our Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl).
We want to be able to group specimens and combine metrics at the collection and institution levels (which can be independant from the way there were published on GBIF).</description>

      <description>If you are a (first time) publisher on GBIF and you are trying to decide which type of dataset would best fit your data, this blogpost is for you.
All the records shared on GBIF are organized into datasets. Each dataset is associated with some metadata describing its content (the classic &amp;ldquo;what, where, when, why, how&amp;rdquo;). The dataset&amp;rsquo;s content depends strongly on the dataset&amp;rsquo;s class. GBIF currently support four types of dataset:</description>

      <description>The data available in GBIF include many so-called &amp;ldquo;duplicate&amp;rdquo; records. This is something that users might be familiar with. You download data from GBIF, analyze them and realize that some records have the same date, scientific name, catalogue number and location but come from two different publishers or have slightly different attributes.
Sometimes an observation was recorded in two different systems, sometimes a specimen was digitized twice, sometimes a record has been enriched with genetic information and republished via a different platform&amp;hellip; There can be many reasons why these duplicates appear on GBIF.</description>
