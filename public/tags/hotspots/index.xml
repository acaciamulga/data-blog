      <description>Idea Post
GBIF organizes and gives statistics for countries and areas, but we do not report on occurrence data for other areas that might be more biologically relevant or important. Should GBIF be doing this? This blog post represents what such reporting might look like if it were done. Currently GBIF has no plans to start doing such reporting.
Currently the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF) recognizes these biodiversity hotspots.</description>
