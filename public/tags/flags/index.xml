      <description>You are a data publisher of occurrence data through GBIF.org, care about your data quality, and wonder what to do about the issue flags that show up on your occurrences. You might have noticed a new type flag this year relating to collection and institution codes and identifiers. They are the result of our attempt at linking specimens records to our Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl).
We want to be able to group specimens and combine metrics at the collection and institution levels (which can be independant from the way there were published on GBIF).</description>

      <description>Publishers share datasets, but also manage data quality. GBIF provides access to the use of biodiversity data, but also flags suspicious or missing content. Users use data, but also clean and remove records. Each play an important role in managing and improving data quality..
What are GBIF issues and flags? The GBIF network publishes datasets, integrating them into a common access system. Here users can retrieve data through common search and download services.</description>
