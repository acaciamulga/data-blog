      <description>During the first-ever virtual GBIF 2021 Global Nodes Meeting, GBIFS hosted a &amp;ldquo;game show&amp;rdquo;: a one-hour &amp;ldquo;battle of Nodes vs. helpdesk&amp;rdquo;. The not-so-hidden goal was to demonstrate some of the lesser known functionalities of GBIF.org through a fun, interactive session.
