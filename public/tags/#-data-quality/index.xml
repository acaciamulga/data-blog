      <description>&lt;p&gt;Biodiversity data papers are a special kind of scientific publication. As explained by &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-S15-S2&#34;&gt;Chavan and Penev (2011)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A data paper is a journal publication whose primary purpose is to describe data, rather than to report a research investigation. As such, it contains facts about data, not hypotheses and arguments in support of those hypotheses based on data, as found in a conventional research article. Its purposes are threefold: to provide a citable journal publication that brings scholarly credit to data publishers; to describe the data in a structured human-readable form; and to bring the existence of the data to the attention of the scholarly community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years many publishers of GBIF data have also published data papers describing their GBIF datasets. If the data paper manuscript was submitted to a Pensoft journal, the dataset was carefully audited (&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.35019&#34;&gt;Penev et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;). Manuscripts were not passed to reviewers until dataset errors in structure, format or compliance with Darwin Core recommendations were corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
