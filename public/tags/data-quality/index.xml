      <description>Publishers share datasets, but also manage data quality. GBIF provides access to the use of biodiversity data, but also flags suspicious or missing content. Users use data, but also clean and remove records. Each play an important role in managing and improving data quality..
What are GBIF issues and flags? The GBIF network publishes datasets, integrating them into a common access system. Here users can retrieve data through common search and download services.</description>

      <title>Understanding basis of record - a living specimen becomes a preserved specimen</title>

      <description>Recently a user noticed that there were Asian Red Pandas (Ailuridae) occurring in North America, and wondered if someone had made a mistake. When an occurrence observation comes from a zoo or botanical garden, it is usually considered a living specimen, but when it comes from a museum it is usually called a preserved specimen. This label helps users remove records that they might not want, which come from zoos.</description>

      <title>GBIF checklist datasets and data gaps</title>

      <description>A checklist dataset is a catch-all term describing any dataset that contains primarily a list of taxonomic names. The lines between a checklist dataset and an occurrence dataset can be blurry.
GBIF classifies at least 6 types of datasets as checklists.
National (or regional) lists of species exampleTaxonomic list of species exampleSpecies description exampleChecklists made up of other checklists GBIF backbone taxonomy &amp;amp; Catalogue of LifeChecklists with occurrences exampleChecklists made from occurrences exampleThe top two are probably what most people imagine when they think of a checklist dataset.</description>

      <description>Gridded datasets are now flagged on the GBIF registryThis update builds on work from a previous blog post.
Gridded datasets are broadly datasets that have low coordinate precision due to rasterized sampling or rounding. This can be a data quality issue because a user might assume an occurrence record has more precision than it actually does.
Current statistics572 datasets are currently flagged as gridded or rasterized on the registry.</description>

      <description>Country Centroids are a known data quality issue within the GBIF network.
Sometimes data publishers will not know the exact lat-lon location of a record and will enter the lat-long center of the country instead. This is a data issue because users might be unaware that an observation is pinned to a country center and assume it is a precise location.
Below I plot the top country centroids found on GBIF within at least 1km.</description>

      <title>Hunger mapping</title>

      <description>Where are we missing biodiversity data?A hunger map is a map of missing biodiversity data (a biodiversity data gap). The main challenge with hunger mapping is proving that a species does not exist but should exist in a region. Hunger maps are important because they could be used to prioritize funding and digitization efforts. Currently, GBIF has no way of telling what species are missing from where. In this blog post I review some potential ways GBIF could make global biodiversity hunger maps.</description>

      <description>EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds (gridded)Naturalis Biodiversity Center (NL) - Aves (not gridded)Gridded data in GBIFGridded datasets are a known problem at GBIF. Many datasets have equally-spaced points in a regular pattern. These datasets are usually systematic national surveys or data taken from some atlas (“so-called rasterized collection designs”).
In this blog post I will describe how I found gridded dataset in GBIF.</description>
