      <description>Citizen scienceCitizen science is scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur (or non-professional) scientists. Biodiversity observations by citizen scientists have become significant in the last 10 years thanks to projects like:
eBirdiNaturalistArtportalen SwedenArtsdatabanken NorwaySouthern African Bird AtlasBird Life AustrailiaDansk Ornitologisk ForeningGreat Back Yard Bird CountThe rise of citizen science on the GBIF networkCitizen scientists have been contributing a large and growing percentage of records to the GBIF network.</description>

      <description>The GBIF maps API is an under-used but powerful web service provided by GBIF. The maps API is used by the main GBIF portal to create the maps including the big map used on gbif.org. We can make a simple call to the API by pasting the link below into a web browser.

      <description>EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds (gridded)Naturalis Biodiversity Center (NL) - Aves (not gridded)Gridded data in GBIFGridded datasets are a known problem at GBIF. Many datasets have equally-spaced points in a regular pattern. These datasets are usually systematic national surveys or data taken from some atlas (“so-called rasterized collection designs”).
In this blog post I will describe how I found gridded dataset in GBIF.</description>

      <description>Link To App
Explanation of toolThis tool plots the downloads through time for species or other taxonomic groups with more than 25 downloads at GBIF. Downloads at GBIF most often occur through the web interface. In a previous post, we saw that most users are downloading data from GBIF via filtering by scientific name (aka Taxon Key). Since the GBIF index currently sits at over 1 billion records (a 400+GB CSV), most users will simplying filter by their taxonomic group of interest and then generate a download.</description>

      <title>GBIF data quality issues and flags what do they mean?</title>

      <description>GBIF gets records from around 1600 (and counting) occurrence datasets.Not all of the data-providers have the time or resources to make sure their datasets are free from errors.
As a service to the biodiversity user community, GBIF flags records that might contain an obvious issue. Some flags are not easy to understand, and most users are probably not aware that they exist or filter them all out by default by leaving the “include records where coordinates are flagged as suspcious” unchecked.</description>
