      <description>Gridded datasets are now flagged on the GBIF registryThis update builds on work from a previous blog post.
Gridded datasets are broadly datasets that have low coordinate precision due to rasterized sampling or rounding. This can be a data quality issue because a user might assume an occurrence record has more precision than it actually does.
Current statistics572 datasets are currently flagged as gridded or rasterized on the registry.</description>

      <description>EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds (gridded)Naturalis Biodiversity Center (NL) - Aves (not gridded)Gridded data in GBIFGridded datasets are a known problem at GBIF. Many datasets have equally-spaced points in a regular pattern. These datasets are usually systematic national surveys or data taken from some atlas (“so-called rasterized collection designs”).
In this blog post I will describe how I found gridded dataset in GBIF.</description>
