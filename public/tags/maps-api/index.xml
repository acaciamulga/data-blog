      <description>GBIF gets records from around 1600 (and counting) occurrence datasets.Not all of the data-providers have the time or resources to make sure their datasets are free from errors.
As a service to the biodiversity user community, GBIF flags records that might contain an obvious issue. Some flags are not easy to understand, and most users are probably not aware that they exist or filter them all out by default by leaving the “include records where coordinates are flagged as suspcious” unchecked.</description>
