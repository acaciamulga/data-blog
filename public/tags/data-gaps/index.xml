      <description>A checklist dataset is a bit of a catch-all term describing any dataset that contains primarily a list of taxonomic names. The lines between a checklist dataset and an occurrence dataset can be blurry.
GBIF classifies at least 6 types of datasets as checklists.
National (or regional) list of species exampleTaxonomic list of species exampleSpecies description exampleChecklists made up of other checklists GBIF backbone taxonomy &amp;amp; Catalogue of LifeChecklists with occurrences exampleChecklists made from occurrences exampleThe top two are probably what most people imagine when they think of a checklist dataset.</description>

      <description>Where are we missing biodiversity data?A hunger map is a map of missing biodiversity data (a biodiversity data gap). The main challenge with hunger mapping is proving that a species does not exist but should exist in a region. Hunger maps are important because they could be used to prioritize funding and digitization efforts. Currently, GBIF has no way of telling what species are missing from where. In this blog post I review some potential ways GBIF could make global biodiversity hunger maps.</description>
