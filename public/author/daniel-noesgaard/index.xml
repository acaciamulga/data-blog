      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve finished an analysis using GBIF-mediated data, you&amp;rsquo;re writing up your manuscript and checking all the references, but you&amp;rsquo;re unsure of how to cite GBIF. If you Google it, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably end up reading our citation guideslines and quickly realize that GBIF is all about DOIs. Datasets have their own DOIs and downloads of aggregated data also have their own DOIs.
But maybe you didn&amp;rsquo;t download data through the GBIF.</description>

      <description>Finding and accessing data There is a lot of GBIF-mediated data available. More than 1.3 B occurrence records covering hundreds of thousands of species in all part of the worlds. All free, open and available at the touch of a button. Users can download data through the GBIF.org portal, via the GBIF API, or one of the third-party tools available for programmatic access, e.g. rgbif.
If there is one area in which GBIF has been immensely successful, it&amp;rsquo;s making the data available to users.</description>
