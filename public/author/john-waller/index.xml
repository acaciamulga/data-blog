      <description>Most mgnify occurrences are bacteria at the genus levelBut there are other occurrunces of plants and animals matched to the species rank.
There has been some dicussion that these type of matches might be un-reliable.
Since it is hard to tell if something simply labeled “Reptile”, “Mammal”, or “Vascular Plant”, but not resolved to a lower level is a legitimate occurrence, I will be focusing mostly on occurrences resovled to the species level.</description>

      <title>Biodiversity hotspot polygons and GBIF data</title>

      <description>Idea Post
GBIF organizes and gives statistics for countries and areas, but we do not report on occurrence data for other areas that might be more biologically relevant or important. Should GBIF be doing this? This blog post represents what such reporting might look like if it were done. Currently GBIF has no plans to start doing such reporting.
Currently the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF) recognizes these biodiversity hotspots.</description>

      <title>Understanding basis of record - a living specimen becomes a preserved specimen</title>

      <description>Recently a user noticed that there were Asian Red Pandas (Ailuridae) occurring in North America, and wondered if someone had made a mistake. When an occurrence observation comes from a zoo or botanical garden, it is usually considered a living specimen, but when it comes from a museum it is usually called a preserved specimen. This label helps users remove records that they might not want, which come from zoos.</description>

      <title>Occurrence Density by Country - 2019</title>

      <description>Here I present a table of occurrence density by country.
Country/Territory can be any region with an iso-2 code. Only countries larger than 10,000 km2 are shown.Density is the total number of occurrence records occurring inside the country (Note this does not mean the record was necessarily published by the country).Change (2017) is the change in density since 2017.Non-bird density is the total density which is not coming from class Aves (i.</description>

      <title>Citizen Science on GBIF - 2019</title>

      <description>Citizen Science datasets on GBIF plotted with all other (gray) GBIF datasets (&amp;gt;100K occurrences). There are many citizen science datasets with millions of occurrences (eBird, (Swedish) Artportalen), and the top 3 datasets on GBIF are all citizen science datasets. But in terms of number of unique species, only iNaturalist competes with large museum datasets like Smithsonian NMNH.
Because of very large datasets like eBird and Artportalen, Citizen Science makes up a large percentage of the total occurrence records on GBIF.</description>

      <title>Exploring es50 for GBIF</title>

      <description>jpg | pdf | svg | code
It has been suggested that GBIF could make es50 maps similar to what organizations like OBIS are already doing. I decided to make one for land animals (graph above). link to code
es50 (Hulbert index) is the statistically expected number of unique species in a random sample of 50 occurrence records, and is an indicator of biodiversity richness. The score can be computed without random sampling, but the mean of infinite random sampling will produce the same result.</description>

      <title>Not a bird download</title>

      <guid>/post/not-a-bird/</guid>
      <description>Recently we were asked on GitHub whether there was a way to get all animal occurrences that are not a bird. This seems like an easy enough request, but unfortunately, there is currently no way to exclude groups from a download search and get everything but a certain group.
A user can get all birds, but they can’t get no birds!
I thought this was an interesting question and probably useful for other people wanting smaller downloads, since there are currenly around half a billion occurrence records for birds.</description>

      <title>Big National Checklists</title>

Big 15-300K total namesMedium 5-15K total namesSmall 0-5K total namesHere I plot the total names in checklists published on GBIF linked to a single country. A checklist dataset is a term for any dataset that contains primarily a list of taxonomic names. National species checklists are lists of species recorded from a country usually through some organized effort. GBIF has published a guide on best practices for making national checklist datasets, which advises making national checklists as big as possible.</description>

      <description>A checklist dataset is a catch-all term describing any dataset that contains primarily a list of taxonomic names. The lines between a checklist dataset and an occurrence dataset can be blurry.
GBIF classifies at least 6 types of datasets as checklists.
National (or regional) lists of species exampleTaxonomic list of species exampleSpecies description exampleChecklists made up of other checklists GBIF backbone taxonomy &amp;amp; Catalogue of LifeChecklists with occurrences exampleChecklists made from occurrences exampleThe top two are probably what most people imagine when they think of a checklist dataset.</description>

      <title>Gridded Datasets Update</title>

      <description>Gridded datasets are now flagged on the GBIF registryThis update builds on work from a previous blog post.
Gridded datasets are broadly datasets that have low coordinate precision due to rasterized sampling or rounding. This can be a data quality issue because a user might assume an occurrence record has more precision than it actually does.
Current statistics572 datasets are currently flagged as gridded or rasterized on the registry.</description>

      <description>Country Centroids are a known data quality issue within the GBIF network.
Sometimes data publishers will not know the exact lat-lon location of a record and will enter the lat-long center of the country instead. This is a data issue because users might be unaware that an observation is pinned to a country center and assume it is a precise location.
Below I plot the top country centroids found on GBIF within at least 1km.</description>

      <description>Where are we missing biodiversity data?A hunger map is a map of missing biodiversity data (a biodiversity data gap). The main challenge with hunger mapping is proving that a species does not exist but should exist in a region. Hunger maps are important because they could be used to prioritize funding and digitization efforts. Currently, GBIF has no way of telling what species are missing from where. In this blog post I review some potential ways GBIF could make global biodiversity hunger maps.</description>

      <description>Citizen scienceCitizen science is scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur (or non-professional) scientists. Biodiversity observations by citizen scientists have become significant in the last 10 years thanks to projects like:

      <description>The GBIF maps api is an under-used but powerful web service provided by GBIF. The maps api is used by the main GBIF portal to create the maps including the big map used on gbif.org. We can make a simple call to the api by pasting the link below into a web browser.

      <description>EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds (gridded)Naturalis Biodiversity Center (NL) - Aves (not gridded)Gridded data in GBIFGridded datasets are a known problem at GBIF. Many datasets have equally-spaced points in a regular pattern. These datasets are usually systematic national surveys or data taken from some atlas (“so-called rasterized collection designs”).
In this blog post I will describe how I found gridded dataset in GBIF.</description>

      <description>Link To App
Explanation of toolThis tool plots the downloads through time for species or other taxonomic groups with more than 25 downloads at GBIF. Downloads at GBIF most often occur through the web interface. In a previous post, we saw that most users are downloading data from GBIF via filtering by scientific name (aka Taxon Key). Since the GBIF index currently sits at over 1 billion records (a 400+GB csv), most users will simplying filter by their taxonomic group of interest and then generate a download.</description>
