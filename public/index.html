      Environmental outliers are a common problem for ecological modelers using GBIF occurrence data.
One common way to remove these outliers is by using reverse jackknifing on environmental surfaces. This type of outlier detection takes the environmental values from point occurrences and checks whether the occurrence is an uncommon value in climate space ( reference pg 51 ).
The jackknife method works by first calculating the sample mean, standard deviation and range; and then steps through the sorted values comparing the distance to the mean of it and the next value.

      Geographic outliers at GBIF are a known problem.
Outliers can be errors, coordinates with high uncertainty, or simply occurrences from an under-sampled region.
In data cleaning pipelines outliers are often removed (even if they are legitimate points) because the researcher does not have time to verify each record one-by-one. In almost all cases, outlier points are occurrences that need attention. Currently, there is no outlier detection implemented at GBIF and it is up to the user to remove outliers themselves (e.

The North American virtual nodes meeting 2020 was on 5 - 6 May 2020The Europe and Central Asia-virtual nodes meeting 2020 was on 11 - 12 May 2020The Latin America and Caribbean virtual nodes meeting 2020 will be on 18 - 20 May 2020The Africa virtual nodes meeting 2020 will be on 10 - 12 June 2020GBIF introduced a regional framework across the GBIF Network a little more than a decade ago, with groups based on clusters of national participants.

      As you probably already know, GBIF.org doesn&rsquo;t host any data. The system relies on each data provider making their data available online in a GBIF-supported format. It also relies on organization letting GBIF know where to find these data (in other words registering the data). But how to do just that?
The good news is that there are several GBIF-compatible systems. They will export or make available the data for you in the correct format and several provide means to register them as datasets on GBIF.

      Most mgnify occurrences are bacteria at the genus levelBut there are other occurrunces of plants and animals matched to the species rank.
There has been some dicussion that these type of matches might be un-reliable.
Since it is hard to tell if something simply labeled “Reptile”, “Mammal”, or “Vascular Plant”, but not resolved to a lower level is a legitimate occurrence, I will be focusing mostly on occurrences resovled to the species level.

All the records shared on GBIF are organized into datasets. Each dataset is associated with some metadata describing its content (the classic &ldquo;what, where, when, why, how&rdquo;). The dataset&rsquo;s content depends strongly on the dataset&rsquo;s class. GBIF currently support four types of dataset:

GBIF organizes and gives statistics for countries and areas, but we do not report on occurrence data for other areas that might be more biologically relevant or important. Should GBIF be doing this? This blog post represents what such reporting might look like if it were done. Currently GBIF has no plans to start doing such reporting.
Currently the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF) recognizes these biodiversity hotspots.

      Recently a user noticed that there were Asian Red Pandas (Ailuridae) occurring in North America, and wondered if someone had made a mistake. When an occurrence observation comes from a zoo or botanical garden, it is usually considered a living specimen, but when it comes from a museum it is usually called a preserved specimen. This label helps users remove records that they might not want, which come from zoos.

All free, open and available at the touch of a button. Users can download data through the GBIF.org portal, via the GBIF API, or one of the third-party tools available for programmatic access, e.g. rgbif.
If there is one area in which GBIF has been immensely successful, it&rsquo;s making the data available to users.

      This past week our informatics team has been updating the Backbone taxonomy on GBIF.org. This is a fairly disruptive process which sometimes involves massive taxonomic changes but DON’T PANIC.
This update is a good thing. It means that some of the taxonomic issues reported have been addressed (see for example this issue concerning the Xylophagidae family) and that new species are now visible on GBIF. Plus, it gives me an excellent opportunity to talk about the GBIF backbone taxonomy and answer some of the questions you might have.

Until recently it was not possible to download occurrences for more than a few hundred species at the same time, but it is now possible to request more species names (up to 100,000 taxonkeys).
For those multiple taxa downloaders out there, GBIF now supports download requests of up to 100,000(!) taxa. That should cover most use cases :) For such large requests, however, you will need to POST you query to the Occurrence Download API service: https://t.

es50 (Hulbert index) is the statistically expected number of unique species in a random sample of 50 occurrence records, and is an indicator of biodiversity richness. The score can be computed without random sampling, but the mean of infinite random sampling will produce the same result.

      Recently we were asked on GitHub whether there was a way to get all animal occurrences that are not a bird. This seems like an easy enough request, but unfortunately, there is currently no way to exclude groups from a download search and get everything but a certain group.
A user can get all birds, but they can’t get no birds!
I thought this was an interesting question and probably useful for other people wanting smaller downloads, since there are currenly around half a billion occurrence records for birds.

Hunger maps are important because they could be used to prioritize funding and digitization efforts. Currently, GBIF has no way of telling what species are missing from where. In this blog post I review some potential ways GBIF could make global biodiversity hunger maps.

      Can we automatically label citizen science datasets? The short answer is yes, partially.
Why label GBIF datasets as &ldquo;citizen science&rdquo;? What is citizen science? Citizen science is scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur (or non-professional) scientists. Citizen science is sometimes described as &ldquo;public participation in scientific research,&rdquo; participatory monitoring, and participatory action research (wikipedia definition).
Citizen science on GBIF A 2016 study showed that nearly half of all occurrence records shared through the GBIF network come from datasets with significant volunteer contributions (for more information, see our &ldquo;citizen science&rdquo; page on gbif.

Explanation of toolThis tool plots the downloads through time for species or other taxonomic groups with more than 25 downloads at GBIF. Downloads at GBIF most often occur through the web interface. In a previous post, we saw that most users are downloading data from GBIF via filtering by scientific name (aka Taxon Key). Since the GBIF index currently sits at over 1 billion records (a 400+GB csv), most users will simplying filter by their taxonomic group of interest and then generate a download.
