      <description>The GBIF maps API is an under-used but powerful web service provided by GBIF. The maps API is used by the main GBIF portal to create the maps including the big map used on gbif.org. We can make a simple call to the API by pasting the link below into a web browser.

      <description>EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds (gridded)Naturalis Biodiversity Center (NL) - Aves (not gridded)Gridded data in GBIFGridded datasets are a known problem at GBIF. Many datasets have equally-spaced points in a regular pattern. These datasets are usually systematic national surveys or data taken from some atlas (“so-called rasterized collection designs”).
In this blog post I will describe how I found gridded dataset in GBIF.</description>

      <description>Link To App
Explanation of toolThis tool plots the downloads through time for species or other taxonomic groups with more than 25 downloads at GBIF. Downloads at GBIF most often occur through the web interface. In a previous post, we saw that most users are downloading data from GBIF via filtering by scientific name (aka Taxon Key). Since the GBIF index currently sits at over 1 billion records (a 400+GB CSV), most users will simplying filter by their taxonomic group of interest and then generate a download.</description>

      <title>GBIF data quality issues and flags what do they mean?</title>

      <description>FlagsNot all data that GBIF recieves is perfect or “fit-for-use” if you want to be politically correct.
Data Quality flags are probably an under-used GBIF feature as some flags are not easy to understand.
In this post I will demystify some of the data quality flags at GBIF.
Coordinates RoundedThis flag gets the top spot because the names has two reasonable interpretations.</description>
