[Here](/post/2019-05-15-big-national-checklists_files/checklistMap.html) I plot the **total names in checklists** published on GBIF linked to a single country. A **checklist dataset** is a term for any dataset that contains primarily a list of taxonomic names. **National species checklists** are lists of species recorded from a country usually through some organized effort. GBIF has published a [guide](https://assets.ctfassets.net/uo17ejk9rkwj/62uueQ2eNGyUyu0yeoEc8i/a9736e0554edff75fdc129f11d031181/gbif_national_checklists_best_practice_guide_en_v1.0.pdf) on best practices for making national checklist datasets, which advises making national checklists **as big as possible**.

Only a few countries have large national checklists over 15,000 names.

# No big checklists in **USA**, **Australia**, **Great Britain**...

<!-- <img src="/post/2019-05-15-big-national-checklists_files/usaChecklist.png" alt="drawing" width="586px"/> -->

Even though the **USA**, **Australia**, and **Great Britain** share with GBIF [massive amounts](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?country=GB&country=US&country=AU) of occurrence records (>600M records combined), they do not seem to publish many checklists. 

This could be for multiple reasons:

1. Perhaps checklists exist but are **simply not published on GBIF**. 
2. Alternatively, the "checklists" in these countries could be included in **occurrence datasets**. 
3. Or the countries feel that occurrence datasets are **superior and sufficient**. 
4. Or I have missed the checklist. (You can comment if you think I have missed a checklist)

**Austrailia** does not publish anything classified as a checklist on GBIF, but the [Atlas of Living of Austrailia](https://www.gbif.org/publisher/3c5e4331-7f2f-4a8d-aa56-81ece7014fc8) serves as default checklist of Austrailia. 

> The Atlas of Living Australia (Atlas) contains information **on all the known species in Australia** aggregated from a wide range of data providers: museums, herbaria, community groups, government departments, individuals and universities. 

The **United States** does not have any large checklists on GBIF, but it does publish many occurrence datasets with wide [taxonomic coverage](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/search?offset=0&type=OCCURRENCE&publishing_country=US).
 
**South Africa's** large plant dataset [BODATSA](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/d0963cee-1a29-47a2-b9bf-fb0e7690077c) is published as an occurrence dataset but could probably used as a **very good checklist** of South African plants. 

**Switzerland** publishes several [occurrence datasets](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/82ad4e4e-f762-11e1-a439-00145eb45e9a) that could probably be used as checklists. 

**New Zealand** also publishes a [national checklist](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/1329753c-0537-451c-92a1-cddaa4534736), but (as of the writing of this post) the names have never be been ingested into GBIF.

GBIF has recently implemented a [species download utility](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/download), so generating "a national checklist" derived from occurrences is now very easy. **Although this is probably not the best way to make a checklist**. 

# Not many checklists where we might want them the most

Most of Asia is occurrence and checklist-poor.

# Will occurrence datasets become the default checklists? 

Creating national checklists is a big job. They are valuable, but governments and foundations with limited budgets might find creating and curating **occurrence datasets** more worthwhile. I personally fear the cost/benefit of checklists might make them too expensive to create for the places where we might want to have them the most. 

## Manual tagging of checklist data

GBIF currently has 27,000 things it calls [checklist datasets](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/search?q=benin&type=CHECKLIST). Even after filtering out 200 datasets from  global publishers, this still leaves a large amount of datasets needing to be tied to a region. 

Checklists are not always tied to any region in a consistent way. There is a standard way to link a checklist to a country code or region that I did not know about before starting this post. It is through the distribution [extension](http://rs.gbif.org/extension/gbif/1.0/distribution.xml), which has a `countryCode` field. **64%** of the checklists I tagged have **filled in the extension**. The remaining untagged datasets have not filled in this extension. 

In order to reduce the size of the tagging job, I decided only to tag datasets with more than 500-1000 species names. I have only tagged checklist so far that are tied to one country and ignored checklists that might be regional like [Fauna Europaea](https://www.gbif.org/en/dataset/90d9e8a6-0ce1-472d-b682-3451095dbc5a). **Fauna Europaea** incidentally has very good [polygon-linked data](https://fauna-eu.org/cdm_dataportal/taxon/ae31893a-2421-4871-8cb4-984587702100). Unfortunately, Fauna Europaea **has not filled in the distribution extension**. 

<img src="/post/2019-05-15-big-national-checklists_files/faunaEuropea.png" alt="drawing"/>

>Using this biggest-first stategy, I have been able to tag around **85% of total names in checklists** (not in global lists), tagging around 600 datasets with country codes. 

I have also tagged any dataset that has filled in the distribution extension or geographic scope information in the meta-data. What has been left un-tagged are a large amount small checklists extracted by **plazi.org**. These untagged datasets are usually newly discovered species lists from the plazi [taxonomic treatments database](https://www.gbif.org/en/publisher/7ce8aef0-9e92-11dc-8738-b8a03c50a862). 

All of the datasets presented in the map above are now tagged in the registry. The following api call will get you all datasets tagged with a country code.
