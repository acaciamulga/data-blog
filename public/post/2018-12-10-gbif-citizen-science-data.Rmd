# What is citizen science 

Citizen science is scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur (or non-professional) scientists. Biodiversity observations by citizen scientists have become significant in the last 10 years thanks to projects like: 

* [eBird](https://ebird.org/home)
* [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/home)
* [Artportalen Sweden](https://www.artportalen.se/)
* [Artsdatabanken Norway](https://www.artsdatabanken.no/)
* [Southern African Bird Atlas](http://sabap2.adu.org.za/)
* [Bird Life Austrailia](https://birdlife.org.au/)
* [Dansk Ornitoligisk Forening](http://www.dof.dk/)
* [Great Back Yard Bird Count](http://gbbc.birdcount.org/)

# The rise of citizen science on the GBIF network

![](/post/2018-12-10-gbif-citizen-science-data_files/growthOfCitizenScienceWeb.jpg)

Citizen scientists have been contributing a large and growing percentage of records to the GBIF network.

# 50% of occurrence records on GBIF are citizen science observations

![](/post/2018-12-10-gbif-citizen-science-data_files/percentageOfGBIFWeb.jpg)

For the last few years, citizen science observations make up around 50% of the biodiversity knowledge on the GBIF network. The [eBird](http://www.birds.cornell.edu/Page.aspx?pid=1478#_ga=2.205672981.721396792.1547556286-1941218201.1542284276) dataset is by far the largest contributor and when this dataset is updated we can see a spike in the percentage graph. In between eBird updates, non-citizen science datasets decrease the percentage. 

# Largest datasets on GBIF are citizen science datasets

**6 of the top 10** datasets on the GBIF network are citizen science datasets. 

# Birds are very very popular...

[interactive version of graph above](https://jhnwllr.github.io/charts/csPlotTopSpecies.html)

**Top 800 species** in citizen science (in terms of number of occurrence records). **617** of the top 800 species observed by citizen scientists are birds. 

* **1st place** (seagull, 8M records)
* First insect **426th place** (red admiral butterfly, 200k records)
* First mammal **540th place** (row deer, 140k records)
* First plant **645th place** (common nettle, 100k records)

# There are > 8 000 000 seagull occurrence records

# Citizen science is less diverse than professional science

![](/post/2018-12-10-gbif-citizen-science-data_files/genusCountsCSWeb.jpg)


Here I plot the number of unique genera observed by citizen scientists against those recorded by non-citizen science datasets or likely collected by professional scientists.

>So while citizen science is an important and growing part of biodiversity data, it cannot replace well-curated professional museum collections and other professional sources.
 
While citizen scientists have observed over **50% of GBIF records** (500 Million!), they have **only 20% of the genera** observed by professional scientists (50k out of around 200k genera). 

# Technical details 

* [Link](https://github.com/jhnwllr/citizen-science) to gitHub with data and R code.  
* [Link](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-citizen-science/) to  in a previous where we describe how we found citizen science datasets. 

You too can get a list of the citizen science datasets using the gbif api. Paste the following link into a web browser and get a list of citizen science datasets via the GBIF api. 

```
http://api.gbif.org/v1/dataset?machineTagNamespace=citizenScience.mgrosjean.gbif.org&limit=500

```
As of the writing of this blog there are **412 datasets** classified as citizen science on the GBIF network.
