# Most mgnify occurrences are bacteria at the genus level 

![](/post/2020-01-08-metagenomics-occurrences-on-gbif_files/metagenomics_top_kingdoms.svg)


But there are other like >100K occurrunces of plants and animals matched to the **species rank**. There has been some dicussion that these type of matches might be un-reliable. 

Since it is hard to tell if something simply labeled "Reptile", "Mammal", or "Vascular Plant", but not resolved to a lower level is a legitimate occurrence, I will be focusing mostly on occurrences resovled to the **species level**. 

# Non-bacteria in metagenomics datasets have a high fraction of geographic outliers

![](/post/2020-01-08-metagenomics-occurrences-on-gbif_files/datasets_by_kingdom_percent_outliers.svg)

Occurrences from kingdom Animalia (rank species) within metagenomics datasets, have a high fraction of geo-graphics outliers. Based on distance outlier detection method and inter-quartile range. 

While distance based outlier detection methods can be give many false positives, it is still concerning that so many metagenomics datasets appear close to the top!!

The datasets with a 100% of there points as outliers are usually some dataset occurring on an island or someplace away from the main concetration of points. 

# Kingdom Animalia Outlier Examples: 

Here I go through many examples of species found within MGnify that have likely geographic outliers. First I cover **Animals** and then move onto **plants**.

# There are less than 10 Birds, Mammals, Reptiles, Amphibian species in MGnify

![](/post/2020-01-08-metagenomics-occurrences-on-gbif_files/species_counts_barplot_with_filter.svg)

Since not many occurrences in MGnify are at rank species, there are not many familiar animals in MGnify. 

# Species counts by Insect order

# Species counts by Plant class 

![](/post/2020-01-08-metagenomics-occurrences-on-gbif_files/species_counts_barplot_with_filter_plants.svg)


Florideophyceae (the class with red algea) is the class with the most species in MGnify

# Plant Outlier Examples:

### Eastern red cedar

* link to [gbif map](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?taxon_key=2684391)
* Hard to tell if <b><span style="color: #FB0101">metagenomics points</span></b> are legitimate. 
* Most points have very little organism quantity backing them up. 
* Would be hard for naive user to know how to interpret this.

### Quercus lobata (Valley oak)

* link to [gbif map](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?taxon_key=2878373)

* Other points also seem outside the natural range. 
* [Point in New Zealand](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1091137039) from museum.  
* [Point in Isreal](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1846534143) might be error. 
* [Point in Spain](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2460559098) citizen science. 
* [Point in Germany](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/616369043) is a specimen from collection in Nuth. Probably not naturally occurring.

### Adiantum pedatum (Northern maidenhair fern)

* link to [gbif map](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?taxon_key=2651832)
* <b><span style="color: #FB0101">metagenomics points</span></b> seem plausible, but none pass a very conservative filter of >10 organsism quanity. 
* [point in South America](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2273846947) might be specimen in museum.

# What is the right cut off?

![](/post/2020-01-08-metagenomics-occurrences-on-gbif_files/probable_outlier_examples.svg)

Here we see that a educated guess for the "right cut off" for relative organism quantity is something around **>0.0005 or >0.0025.** **I excluded Eastern Red Cedar** from this plot, since it was the example with the most plausible points (although none its points had a relative organism quanity >0.0025). 


# What happens when we use a cutoff of 0.0025? 

![](/post/2020-01-08-metagenomics-occurrences-on-gbif_files/relative_organism_quantity.svg)

This **filter excludes 90% of MGnify occurrences**.
