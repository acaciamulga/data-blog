**Environmental outliers** are a common problem for ecological modelers using **GBIF** occurrence data. 

```{R,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
plot_name = "surface_plot"
```

One common way to remove these outliers is by using **reverse jackknifing** on [environmental surfaces](https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html). This type of outlier detection takes the environmental values from point occurrences and checks whether the occurrence is an uncommon value in climate space ( [reference pg 51](https://www.gbif.org/document/80528/principles-and-methods-of-data-cleaning-primary-species-and-species-occurrence-data) ).

> The **jackknife method** works by first calculating the sample mean, standard deviation and range; and then steps through the sorted values comparing the distance to the mean of it and the next value. Where the distance to mean between values is above a threshold level then that sample value and those further away from the mean are flagged as outliers. An outlierness metric is also calculated for the sample value. - [source link ](https://code.google.com/archive/p/ala-dataquality/wikis/DETECTED_OUTLIER_JACKKNIFE.wiki)

**Environmental outliers** can arise for a few reasons: 

1. A point that is a mistake (mirrored lat-lon, some other data-entry mistake)
2. A point that is a centroid (of a cournty or region) [previous blog post](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/country-centroids/)
3. A point located at a zoo, herbarium, or other institution 
4. A point sampled from a [gridded dataset](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/finding-gridded-datasets/)
5. A point occurs in a micro-climate that is below the resolution of the climate surface
6. Or naturally because of chance

**1-4** are usually seen as undesirable for most users. 

Here is a typical result from a reverse-jackknifing run. The **outlier** occurs at the [Oregon Regional Primate Research Center](https://www.ohsu.edu/onprc). Previously, I discussed a [techinque](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/outlier-detection-using-dbscan/) for discovering outliers that uses **distance** from other points. In this example, a distance based-method would also spot this environmental outlier.

```{R,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
plot_name = "8978926"
```

**Cumulative frequency plots** are to the right. Bioclimatic surface values are on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis. **Black-colored points** very much to the right or left are outliers. I also write the number (**7**) of other surfaces that flagged this point as an outlier as a little number next to the point. Because of multiple-comparisons, a point should probably not be considered a "true outlier" unless it an outlier in > 5 surfaces (depending on the number of surfaces used).

 **Environmental surfaces**, however, give us the power to spot outliers that occur within the main-blob of other occurrence points.  

```{R,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
plot_name = "8493215"
```

In this example the **outliers** happen to all come from **iNaturalist** ( [1](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1920812594), [2](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2576278969) ). At least one of the [outliers](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/17283719) appears to be close to a [private wildlife park](http://www.yacumama.com.pe/es/).  Within-range outlier flagging **would not** be possible with only IUCN or [iNaturalist range maps](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/43389-Saguinus-fuscicollis). 

## Reverse jackknifing all of GBIF

I was able to run reverse jackknifing on all GBIF Animal, Plant, and Fungi records. I ported the `biogeo::rjack` [implementation](https://github.com/cran/biogeo/blob/master/R/rjack.R) into scala-spark in order to run on the cluster  ( [GitHub](https://github.com/jhnwllr/gbif_reverse_jackknife) ). This takes around 25 minutes on the current GBIF cluster set up. I used the 19 [bioclim variables](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/17283719) at a 0.1 degree resolution. These variables are only available **on land**, so nothing aquatic was run.There are environmental layers for the [oceans](http://www.marspec.org/) that can also be used for outlier detection. I ran on all land species with more than 20 unique bioclim values. 

## GBIF Outlier Statistics 

Around 2M occurrences get flagged with at least 1 surface (of 19) as an outlier. But most of these are probably false positives because of multiple comparisons. Around 150K occurrences are flagged with >=5 surfaces. 

**Preserved specimens** have more than two times the number of outliers as **human observations**, even though there are six times fewer preserved specimen records. 

```{R,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
plot_name = "basisofrecord_barplot"
```

**Preserved specimens** are often geocoded from locality and have a high uncertainty. Most datasets had less than 1% of their occurrences flagged. 

## Additional outlier examples 

Here I plot some additional outlier examples from my full GBIF run (all turned out to be centroid related). 


<div style="outline: 5px solid #F9F9F9;">

**Example 1**

```{R,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
plot_name = "5219573"
```

![](`r path_to_plots`/`r plot_name`.jpg)

The [outlier](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/476819916) is a **preserved specimen** and location is known only from a locality description. Additionally, the point has a [known](https://github.com/gbif/portal-feedback/issues/2428) default (and wrong) coordinate uncertainty (**301m**) from GeoLocate. 

</div>

<div style="outline: 5px solid #F9F9F9;">

```{R,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
plot_name = "2685400"
```

The [outlier](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1828885044) is a **preserved specimen** and occurs at the centroid of the city of **Tateyama**.   

</div>

<div style="outline: 5px solid #F9F9F9;">

**Example 3**

```{R,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, results="hide"}

The [outlier](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1701728186) is a **preserved specimen** and occurs at the centroid of the **United States**.  

</div>

<div style="outline: 5px solid #F9F9F9;">

**Example 4**

```{R,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
plot_name = "5285635"
```

![](`r path_to_plots`/`r plot_name`.jpg)

The [outlier](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1228589777) is a **preserved specimen** and occurs at the centroid of the **Quebec**.  

</div>


<div style="outline: 5px solid #F9F9F9;">

**Example 5**

```{R,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
plot_name = "2436544"
```

![](`r path_to_plots`/`r plot_name`.jpg)

The [outlier](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/865719213) is a **preserved specimen** and occurs close to the centroid of **Senegal**. The other gray points near the black outlier point are outliers only on this surface. While the outlier in Senegal is an outlier on 7 other surfaces.

</div>

<div style="outline: 5px solid #F9F9F9;">

**Example 6**

```{R,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
plot_name = "5219566"
```

![](`r path_to_plots`/`r plot_name`.jpg)

The [outlier](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/865719199) is a **preserved specimen** and is likely a centroid of **Africa**. It also is an outlier in **5** other bioclim surfaces.

## Cleaning GBIF downloads using reverse jackknifing

Currently, there is no outlier detection implemented on GBIF.org. You can view the results of my full GBIF run [here](). It also is possible to do reverse jackknife outlier detection in R on your own download.  

```R  

library(tibble)
library(raster)
library(dplyr) # load dplyr after raster to avoid select conflict
library(sp)
library(rgbif)
library(biogeo)

# get data from worldclim
path = "C:/Users/ftw712/Desktop/" # set a path to somewhere to save the data
r = getData('worldclim', var='bio', res=10,path=path) 

# get data from GBIF
occ_data = occ_search(
taxonKey = 5284989, # a pine tree species 
limit = 2000,
hasCoordinate = TRUE,
hasGeospatialIssue = FALSE,
country = "US",
)$data %>%
filter(
coordinateUncertaintyInMeters < 1000 | # filter with high uncertainty
is.na(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters)) %>%  
filter(basisOfRecord == "PRESERVED_SPECIMEN") %>% # Let's only consider other specimens
mutate(row_number = row_number()) %>%
select(row_number,key,scientificName,decimalLatitude,decimalLongitude) %>%
glimpse() 

coords = occ_data %>%
select(decimalLongitude,decimalLatitude) 

points = SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords,data=occ_data,proj4string=r@crs)

values = extract(r,points) %>%
as.data.frame() %>%
`/`(10) %>% # divide by 10 to get temp in C
mutate(row_number = occ_data$row_number) %>%
na.omit() 

# reverse jackknife from biogeo 
# this function returns the row_number of the outlier 
outlier_index = rjack(values$bio4) # bio4 is seasonality  

# merge back with original occ_data
outliers = values %>%
select(bio4,row_number) %>%
mutate(rjack_outlier = row_number %in% outlier_index) %>%
filter(rjack_outlier) %>%
merge(occ_data,id="row_number") 

outliers # which points were flagged as outliers 

# this outlier is centroid of the USA
# https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1701728186
