      <p>Biodiversity data papers are a special kind of scientific publication. As explained by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-S15-S2">Chavan and Penev (2011)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A data paper is a journal publication whose primary purpose is to describe data, rather than to report a research investigation. As such, it contains facts about data, not hypotheses and arguments in support of those hypotheses based on data, as found in a conventional research article. Its purposes are threefold: to provide a citable journal publication that brings scholarly credit to data publishers; to describe the data in a structured human-readable form; and to bring the existence of the data to the attention of the scholarly community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In recent years many publishers of GBIF data have also published data papers describing their GBIF datasets. If the data paper manuscript was submitted to a Pensoft journal, the dataset was carefully audited (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.35019">Penev et al. 2019</a>). Manuscripts were not passed to reviewers until dataset errors in structure, format or compliance with Darwin Core recommendations were corrected.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As of 2021-07-13, 100 GBIF datasets had passed through the Pensoft audit process and in many cases had been substantially improved. In this blog post I give an overview of the data errors found in the GBIF datasets.</p>

<p>In this overview I&rsquo;ve used data problem categories that overlap to some extent, and although I avoided double-counting an error, the numbers should not be regarded as exact sample statistics. The numbers are also minima, as I haven&rsquo;t counted very minor errors that occurred only once or twice in a dataset.</p>

<p>Please also note that the 100 datasets audited were <em>original</em> datasets, not the datasets after processing by GBIF. These original datasets were downloaded as Darwin Core &ldquo;source archives&rdquo; from IPTs or from the GBIF website. There is, of course, some overlap between the data quality checks carried out independently by Pensoft and by GBIF. From the data publisher&rsquo;s point of view, an important difference is that GBIF does not require publishers to fix the problems it identifies.</p>

<p>The cost of the data auditing service provided by Pensoft is included in the article processing charges for the data paper. Pensoft also offers data auditing and cleaning as a stand-alone service (<a href="https://blog.pensoft.net/2020/10/21/data-checking-for-biodiversity-collections-and-other-biodiversity-data-compilers-from-pensoft/">Mesibov 2020</a>). For information about the tools Pensoft uses to audit GBIF and other data, see <a href="https://www.datafix.com.au/cookbook/"><em>A Data Cleaner&rsquo;s Cookbook</em></a> and its companion blog <a href="https://www.datafix.com.au/BASHing/"><em>BASHing data</em></a>.</p>

<h2 id="structural-problems">Structural problems</h2>

<p>Three datasets contained records with <strong>field shifts</strong>, where blocks of data items were shifted &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;left&rdquo; into fields in which they did not belong.</p>

<p>Four datasets had incompletely joined &ldquo;event.txt&rdquo; and &ldquo;occurrence.txt&rdquo; files. In other words, there were <em>eventID</em> entries in &ldquo;occurrence.txt&rdquo; that were not found in &ldquo;event.txt&rdquo;. In a database, this would be called a <strong>referential integrity failure</strong>. Another dataset contained an &ldquo;extendedmeasurementorfact.txt&rdquo; table with no joining field (foreign key) at all.</p>

<h2 id="file-content-problems">File content problems</h2>

<p>Five occurrence-record datasets contained records that were exact <strong>duplicates</strong> apart from the unique code in <em>occurrenceID</em>. Some partial-duplicate records were also queried during audits and removed by authors after inspection.</p>

<p>Two occurrence-record datasets contained <strong>non-unique identifiers</strong>, i.e. duplicate codes in <em>occurrenceID</em>.</p>

<p>Sixty-two of the 100 datasets lacked one or more of 17 fields where the data context required that field to be present. These <strong>missing fields</strong> included <em>eventDate</em> (seven datasets) and <em>occurrenceID</em> (one dataset), which GBIF <a href="https://www.gbif.org/data-quality-requirements-occurrences">requires</a> in occurrence record datasets. The most frequently omitted field was <em>coordinateUncertaintyInMeters</em> (21 datasets).</p>

<h2 id="between-field-content-problems">Between-field content problems</h2>

<p>In 23 of the datasets, there were <strong>valid entries in the wrong field</strong>, with 25 fields affected. A simple example would be the entry &ldquo;Holotype of Aus bus Smith, 1900&rdquo; in the <em>type</em> field rather than in <em>typeStatus</em>.</p>

<p>Nearly half the datasets (49) contained <strong>disagreements between fields within a single record</strong>. Most of the disagreements were in taxon name fields, for example the <em>genus</em> or <em>specificEpithet</em> entries disagreeing with the entry in <em>scientificName</em>. Other common disagreements were between <em>eventDate</em> and <em>year</em>, <em>month</em> or <em>day</em>. This category of problems also includes minimum depth or elevation greater than maximum depth or elevation, and date anomalies such as <em>dateIdentified</em> before <em>eventDate</em>.</p>

<p>Spatial data formed a sub-category of between-field content problems. In many datasets, it was apparent that the data compilers did not clearly understand the relationship between coordinate values, coordinate uncertainty and coordinate precision.</p>

<h2 id="within-field-content-problems">Within-field content problems</h2>

<p>This category holds most of the problems identified in Pensoft audits.</p>

<p>Seventy-one of the 100 datasets had <strong>invalid or incorrect entries</strong> in one or more of 57 fields. The nature of the error varied with the field. In <em>scientificName</em>, for example, invalid entries ranged from &ldquo;Sponge massive violet&rdquo; to &ldquo;Hesperiidae sp.&rdquo;, while 33°58&rsquo;18.69&rdquo; was a data error in <em>decimalLongitude</em>.</p>

<p>Forty-six datasets had <strong>missing-but-expected entries</strong> in one or more of 41 fields (<strong>completeness failure</strong>, in data science). Often the fields had valid entries in some records, but blanks in others.</p>

<p>A common problem was <strong>pseudo-duplication</strong>, where the same entry appeared in a field in more than one format (<strong>consistency failure</strong>). Pseudo-duplications were found in 33 fields across 36 datasets.</p>

<p>Two datasets had an <strong>incrementing fill-down error</strong>, in which an entry such as &ldquo;WGS84&rdquo; in <em>geodeticDatum</em> appeared as &ldquo;WGS84&rdquo;, &ldquo;WGS85&rdquo;, &ldquo;WGS86&rdquo;, &ldquo;WGS87&rdquo; etc.</p>

<h2 id="data-item-formatting-problems">Data item formatting problems</h2>

<p>Sixty-five datasets had <strong>non-recommended, incorrect or inconsistent formats</strong> for data items in one or more of 31 fields. The <em>eventDate</em> field, for example, should contain dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, but data publishers used a wide range of other formats including Microsoft&rsquo;s serial date numbers, and sometimes mixed the date formats within a single dataset.</p>

<p>Thirty datasets had <strong>NITS</strong> as the sole entry in one or more of 29 fields. NITS (<strong>N</strong>othing <strong>I</strong>nteresting <strong>T</strong>o <strong>S</strong>ay) are entries like &ldquo;-&rdquo;, &ldquo;??&rdquo;, &ldquo;nodata&rdquo; and &ldquo;N/A&rdquo; that fill in for missing data and can be replaced by blanks.</p>

<p>Three datasets had <strong>truncated data items</strong> in four fields. These typically arise when data items exceed a character-count limit in a database field.</p>

<p>Six datasets had <strong>unnecessary quoting</strong> around data items in nine fields. Excess quoting often appears in a dataset built from a CSV file in which quotes are used to surround data items containing commas or spaces.</p>

<h2 id="character-problems-in-data-items">Character problems in data items</h2>

<p>Thirty-four datasets had <strong>encoding conversion failures</strong> in a range of fields, but most often in <em>scientificName</em>. Characters not in the basic ASCII set of letters and punctuation had been replaced by &ldquo;?&rdquo;, &#xFFFD;, invisible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character">control characters</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake">mojibake</a> (e.g. &ldquo;Lefèbvre&rdquo; became &ldquo;LefÃ¨bvre&rdquo;) by the time the data had been UTF-8 encoded for GBIF use. Another two datasets had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character">combining characters</a> in place of characters with diacritical marks.</p>

<p>A common character issue was the replacement of plain spaces with <strong>no-break spaces</strong> (NBSPs). An NBSP tells a Web browser or word-processing program that the words on either side of the NBSP are not to be spread across lines, and must remain together on the same line. NBSPs are invisible and a human reader cannot see the difference between <em>Aus bus</em> with a plain space and <em>Aus bus</em> with an NBSP. A text-parsing program will not only see the difference but will treat the two names as different. NBSPs were found in 17 fields across 39 datasets and were particularly abundant in <em>scientificName</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-about-dataset-quality">What to do about dataset quality?</h2>

<p>GBIF datasets account for about 40% of the audits for Pensoft data papers since 2017. The non-GBIF datasets had the same range of problems as the GBIF ones, but between-field and within-field problems were much less common in datasets which did <em>not</em> use the Darwin Core framework.</p>

<p>It would be great if GBIF dataset compilers</p>

<ul>
<li>knew the <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/">basics of Darwin Core</a></li>
<li>knew <a href="https://www.gbif.org/data-quality-requirements-occurrences">GBIF&rsquo;s data quality requirements and recommendations</a></li>
<li>knew the <a href="https://docs.gbif.org/georeferencing-best-practices/1.0/en/">basics of georeferencing</a></li>
<li>knew the <a href="https://kunststube.net/encoding/">basics of character encoding</a></li>
<li>knew about spreadsheet hazards (if using spreadsheets to compile data) such as field shifts, fill-down errors, empty end-of-record fields and unwanted re-formatting of dates and numbers</li>
<li>knew how to efficiently check for between-field and within-field data problems</li>
</ul>

<p>The Pensoft experience, however, has been that many compilers do not have the necessary knowledge or skills to produce tidy, complete, consistent and Darwin Core-compliant datasets. For those Pensoft authors, a post-compilation data-checking service has been both welcome and worthwhile.</p>
