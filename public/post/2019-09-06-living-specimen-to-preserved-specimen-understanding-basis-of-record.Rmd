Recently a user noticed that there were **Asian Red Pandas** (Ailuridae) occurring in [North America](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?basis_of_record=PRESERVED_SPECIMEN&country=US&taxon_key=9673), and wondered if someone had made a mistake. When an occurrence observation comes from a **zoo** or **botanical garden**, it is usually considered a [living specimen](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#livingspecimen), but when it comes from a museum it is usually called a [preserved specimen](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#preservedspecimen). This label helps users remove records that they might not want, which come from zoos.

The Asian Red Panda the user [found](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1702720584) in the United States was labeled as a **preserved specimen** because it had been collected in the United States from a zoo. So the red panda really was from the United States!

Such edged cases are difficult to filter using **basis of record** only. Probably the best way to filter these cases would be to filter any record that has "Zoo" or "Botanical Garden" in the **verbatim locality** column, although this would require downloading the larger **Darwin Core Files**. Perhaps in the future GBIF should consider flagging records that occur near zoos or botanical gardens.
